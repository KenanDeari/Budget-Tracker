# Online/Offline Budget Trackers

Based off our existing Budget Tracker application, I added functionality to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, the data will populate the total when brought back online.

# Offline Functionality:

  Application will allow users to enter deposits offline.

  Application will allow users to enter expenses offline.

# -When brought back online:

   All offline entries will be added to tracker.

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
